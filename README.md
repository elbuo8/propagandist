# Propangandist

This is a simple tool for those technical bloggers out there. If you are using the [Embed GitHub Gist](http://wordpress.org/plugins/embed-github-gist/) in your WP Blog and you like to write in Markdown, you should stick around.

Propagandist will parse out [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) and generate the HTML output WP expects. But more importantly,
it will convert your code snippets into Embedded Gists.
